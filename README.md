# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Using-Python-
End-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis using Python to clean raw data, analyze distributions, visualize trends, and derive actionable business insights.

Project Description:

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to understand the structure, quality, and patterns within the dataset. The analysis involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation to convert raw data into a structured and analysis-ready format that supports business decision-making.

Objective:

To explore and understand the dataset by identifying data quality issues, uncovering trends and relationships, and generating actionable insights through statistical analysis and visualizations.

Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning
NumPy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

Methodology Overview:

Loaded and inspected the dataset to understand structure and data types.
Cleaned data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Performed descriptive statistics and distribution analysis.
Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to identify trends and relationships.
Visualized key patterns using charts and plots.
Summarized insights to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Outcomes:

Improved data quality and consistency.
Identified important trends, outliers, and anomalies.
Generated meaningful insights from raw data.
Prepared a clean and structured dataset for further analysis or dashboarding.

Insights & Observations:

Detected data inconsistencies affecting analysis accuracy.
Identified variables with strong influence on overall trends.
Observed relationships between key features through visual analysis.
Highlighted areas requiring further investigation or modeling.

Visualizations:

Distribution plots to understand data spread.
Bar charts and histograms for categorical and numerical analysis.
Box plots to detect outliers.
Trend and comparison charts for pattern analysis.
